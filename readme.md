## Usage

The first step to using our platform is to create an account, without an account the user cannot login to access anything beyond the base page. The password and e-mail must satisify certain guidelines in order for the account creation to be successful. After creating an account, the user's data will be stored into the database. The user then goes to login page to enter their login information, if itâ€™s within the database the website will reroute them to the home page. From the home page user will be able to access all sorts of information such as announcements, book inventory, and profile. 

As an admin and librarian, they can manage users and delete certain users. Librarians cannot delete admins, but admins can delete librarians. Admins and librarians can also manage book inventory and choose to add/delete books. From the 'Manage Users' tab, the admin and librarian can also view every users profile. IF they visit a students profile, they can see what book they have checked out.

The user can choose to update their bio and other user account information on the profile page, where the bio must adhere to certain guidelines. The user can choose to delete their account on their profile page by clicking the Delete Account option, followed by entering their password to ensure their removal from the database. Finally, if the user decides to logout, the button will be on the left column of the website, which would direct them back to the base page of our website.

As a student, to checkout a book the user would navigate to the 'Browse Books' tab using the sidebar. From there, the user is provided with a list of books in the book inventory and their availability. The user can then click on the 'Checkout' button to checkout the book. Similarly, the user can also return the book by clicking on the 'Return' button. To view what books the user has checked out, the user can navigate to the 'My Books' tab using the sidebar. From here, the user can also click on the 'Return' button to return the book from this page.

Our website also allows access to guests, who can view the base annoucement page, browse book inventory, and the help page. However, as a guest they cannot checkout/return books, only to view what books are in inventory and are avaialable. The help page also provides information on how to use our website, and the base page provides a brief announcment created by the admins.
